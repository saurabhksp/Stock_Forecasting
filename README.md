This project is a web-based stock forecasting application developed using Python and Streamlit. It is designed to provide users with an interactive platform to analyze stock performance, assess risk using financial models, and predict future price trends. The application combines traditional financial theories such as the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) with machine learning techniques to deliver insightful analytics and forecasts.

The application includes several key modules. The CAPM Beta module calculates the sensitivity of a stock relative to market movements, helping users understand the stock’s risk level. The CAPM Return module estimates the expected return on a stock based on its beta, the risk-free rate, and the market return. These calculations help investors evaluate whether the return justifies the associated risk.

The Stock Analysis module offers visual and statistical insights into a company’s historical stock performance. It displays trends in closing prices, trading volumes, and price volatility, allowing users to explore how the stock has behaved over time. The Stock Prediction module uses machine learning models to forecast future stock prices based on historical data, providing valuable information for making informed investment decisions.

Overall, this application offers a complete environment for users to explore financial data, perform investment analysis, and generate stock predictions through a simple and interactive Streamlit interface. It serves as a valuable educational and analytical tool for students, researchers, and retail investors interested in financial markets and data-driven forecasting.
